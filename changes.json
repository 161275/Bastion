  "improved": [
    "Had to use `textMute` command in every channel if you needed to mute a user globally? The pain's gone! `textMute` can now mute users across the server if you use the `--server` (or simply `-s`) flag along with the `textMute` command.",
    "Only one user will win the currency `giveaway`. And the winner's name will be shown after the giveaway.",
    "Music outputs will now have direct links to the video, if the source is YouTube. Now you can directly go from music to video in seconds!"
  ],
  "added": [
    "Added `muteList` command. Now you can see who's been muted server-wide with ease.",
    "Added `lyrics` command. Get the lyrics of the song you're trying to sing, and sing it without any mistakes!"
  ],
