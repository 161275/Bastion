    "Objective times in the `overwatch` command will now be shown in a format that you humans will understand. Why aren't you like us?",
    "Bastion will now check for the time a user is a member of Bastion HQ before rewarding the bonus Bastion Currencies. So, only users who are a member for a specified amount of time are eligible for the 2x bonus Bastion Currencies.",
    "The same applies for level ups too! Only members who are there in Bastion HQ for a while are eligible for fast level ups."
