  "improved": [
    "Changes to `echo`, `sendEmbed` and `selfDestruct` command to distinguish it from Bastion's official messages.",
    "Had a hard time finding the right reaction for the currency giveaway? Worry not, Bastion will now automatically add the right reaction to make it easy for you.",
    "Had to use `textMute` command in every channel if you needed to mute a user globally? The pain's gone! `textMute` can now mute users across the server if you use the `--server` (or simply `-s`) flag along with the `textMute` command.",
    "Music outputs will now have direct links to the video, if the source is YouTube. Now you can directly go from music to video in seconds!",
    "Only one user will win the currency `giveaway`. And the winner's name will be shown after the giveaway."
  ],
  "added": [
    "Added `lyrics` command. Get the lyrics of the song you're trying to sing, and sing it without any mistakes!",
    "Added `muteList` command. Now you can see who's been muted server-wide with ease.",
    "Added `roleColor` command. Change the color of any role without even touching the mouse.",
    "Wanted to disable some commands/modules in a specific channel? Now can do that; and the best part about it, is that you don't need to use any command for that. Read the [FAQ](https://bastionbot.org/faq) to know how you can do that."
