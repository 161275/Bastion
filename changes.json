  "fixed": [
    "`skip` command won't go rogue anymore. It won't skip multiple songs; will skip one song at a time.",
    "Fixed an issue that prevented music commands from responding when the music channels and/or the music master role was removed from the server before removing it from Bastion."
  ],
  "improved": [
    "Renamed `setGame` to `setActivity` since Bastion now supports watching and listening activities, and game isn't the right word for it. `setGame` is now an alias for it.",
    "`userInfo` now supports watching and listening activities of users. And now, it will show *Offline* instead of *Invisible*.",
    "`setActivity` command, now, also can set the activity type to *Playing* or *Watching*.",
    "You can now cycle through the entire leaderboard as `leaderboard` is now paginated.",
    "`modules` is now an alias of `commands` command.",
    "The good old `commands` is back to how it worked earlier. We saw that new users were having trouble when it displayed modules instead of commands.",
    "Under-the-hood improvements"
  ],
  "added": [
    "Bastion now supports watching and listening activities.",

    "See the users who contribute to the development of the Bastion Bot on [GitHub](https://github.com/TheBastionBot/Bastion) using the `contributors` command.",
    "You can now reload Bastion's settings using the `reloadSettings` command. No need to restart Bastion after you've modified the `config.json` or `credentials.json` file.",
    "Browse the games in different categories of the Steam Store using the all new `steam` command.",
    "Always forget to add a reason for a moderation action? Don't worry. You can now edit the reason of a moderation log message using the new `reason` command.",
    "Organizing a competition, or any event, that requires public votes? Bastion can do the hard lifting for you now. You can set channels in your server as voting channels using the new `votingChannels` command. When a user posts a message in a voting channel their message will automatically get 'üëç' and 'üëé' reactions."
